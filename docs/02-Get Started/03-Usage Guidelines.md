# Usage Guidelines
Follow the guidelines and recommendations below to ensure code reliability and avoid common pitfalls.

## SDK Class Usage
### Do not extend SDK classes
The SDK provides all necessary functionality out of the box. Do not extend any Navigation SDK for Flutter classes. Instead, use the callback methods and interfaces provided by the SDK.

### Avoid @internal members
Members, methods, and fields annotated with @internal are for internal use only and should not be accessed by your application.

**Do not use:**

- **Fields**: `pointerId`, `mapId` `getters/fields`
- **Methods**: 
  - Constructors initializing `pointerId` or `mapId` with -1
  - `fromJson` and `toJson` methods (JSON structure may change between versions)
  - Listener methods like `notify...` or `handleEvent`
  - Class `init` methods
- **FFI classes**: `GemKitPlatform`, `GemSdkNative`, `GemAutoreleaseObject`

> 🚨 **Alert**: Using internal elements can cause unexpected behavior and compatibility issues. These are not part of the public API and may change without notice.

## Working with Parameters
### DateTime Requirements
Ensure `DateTime` values passed to SDK methods are valid positive UTC values. Values below `DateTime.utc(0)` are not supported.

### Units of Measurement
The SDK uses SI units by default:

- **Distance**: Meters
- **Time**: Seconds
- **Mass**: Kilograms
- **Speed**: Meters per second
- **Power**: Watts

Configure the unit system for TTS instructions via `SDKSettings.unitSystem`.

> 🚨 **Alert**: Some fields use different units where more appropriate. For example, `TruckProfile` dimensions (`height`, `length`, `width`) are in **centimeters**. Check the API reference for specifics.

## Event Listeners
Follow these principles when working with event listeners:

- **Subscribe**: Use provided register methods or constructor parameters
- **Single callback**: Only one callback is active per event type; registering a new callback **overrides** the previous one
- **Unsubscribe**: Register an empty callback to unsubscribe

## Error Handling
### Check Error Codes
Always check error codes returned by SDK methods to handle failures appropriately.

The `GemError` enum indicates operation outcomes. Success values include:

- `success` — Operation completed successfully
- `reducedResult` — Partial results returned
- `scheduled` — Operation scheduled for later execution

### Using ApiErrorService
Some methods don't return `GemError` directly but may still fail. Use the `ApiErrorService` class to check the error code:
```
// Any SDK call...
GemError error = ApiErrorService.apiError;
if (error == GemError.success) print("The last operation succeeded.");
else print("The last operation failed with error: $error");
```
> 🚨 **Alert**: Check the error code using `ApiErrorService.apiError `immediately after the operation completes. Other SDK operations may overwrite the error code.

### Monitor Error Updates
Register a listener to get notified when error codes change:
```
ApiErrorService.registerOnErrorUpdate((error) {
    if (error == GemError.success) print("An operation succeeded");
    else print("An operation failed with error code $error")
});
```

## Asynchronous Operations
### Converting callbacks to Futures
Many SDK operations (search, routing, etc.) use callbacks to return results. Use a `Completer` to convert callbacks into `Future` objects:

```
Future<ResultType?> myFunction() async{
    final Completer<ResultType?> completer = Completer<ResultType?>();

    SomeGemService.doSomething(
        onComplete: (error, result){
            if (error == GemError.success && result != null){
                completer.complete(result);
            }
        }
    )

    return completer.future;
}
```
This simplifies asynchronous code handling. Learn more in the [Dart Completer documentation](link://https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/dart-async/Completer-class.html).

### Avoid Isolates
Do not execute SDK operations inside isolates. The SDK already uses multithreading internally where appropriate. Using isolates may cause exceptions.

## Debugging and Logging
When reporting issues, always include SDK logs to help diagnose problems.

### Enable Dart-level Logs
Configure logging to print messages to the console:

```
Debug.logCreateObject = true;
Debug.logCallObjectMethod = true;
Debug.logListenerMethod = true;

Debug.logLevel = GemLoggingLevel.all;
```
This enables logging for Dart-level operations.


### Enable native-level Logs
The SDK also generates native (C++) logs, written to a file automatically.

**Add a log entry:**
```
Debug.log(level: GemDumpSdkLevel.info, message: "This is a log message");
``` 

**Set log level:**
```
await Debug.setSdkDumpLevel(GemDumpSdkLevel.verbose);
```

**Get log file path:**
```
String logFilePath = await Debug.sdkLogDumpPath;
```
**Platform support:**
- **Android**: All `GemLoggingLevel` values supported
- **iOS**: Only `GemDumpSdkLevel.silent `and `GemDumpSdkLevel.verbose` supported

> 📝 **Note:** Provide both Dart and native logs when reporting issues.

> 🚨 **Alert**: Logs may contain sensitive information. Review before sharing publicly.

### Information Checklist for Bug Reports
When reporting issues, include:

- **Description**: Clear, concise bug description
- **Reproduction steps**: Include minimal code sample if possible
- **Expected vs. actual behavior**
- **Visual aids**: Screenshots or videos (if applicable)
- **SDK version**
- **Platform details**: iOS/Android, OS version, device model
- **Logs**: Console output during the issue
- **Location**: Geographic location for routing/navigation/search issues
- **SDK version**: Ensure you're using the latest version

## Resource Management
### Modifying Resources Safely
Some resources load before GemKit.initialize() to improve startup speed. Manually changing resources (maps, styles, icons) can cause crashes or be ignored, especially on Android.

If you need to modify resources, use one of these approaches:

**Option 1: Disable early initialization**
In `android/build.gradle`, add this to the `buildTypes` block:
```
    buildTypes {
        debug {
            buildConfigField "boolean", "USE_EARLY_INIT", "false"
        }
        release {
            buildConfigField "boolean", "USE_EARLY_INIT", "false"
        }
        profile {
           buildConfigField "boolean", "USE_EARLY_INIT", "false"
        }
    }
```

**Option 2: Initialize and release SDK**
Unload resources before making changes:
```
await GemKit.initialize(...);
await GemKit.release();

// Modify the resources

await GemKit.initialize(...);
await GemKit.release();
```
This ensures resources are properly unloaded before applying changes.

## Common Issues
### Avoid Name Conflicts
The SDK's `Route` class may conflict with Flutter's `Route` class. Hide Flutter's version when importing:
```
import 'package:flutter/material.dart' hide Route;
```

## Legal Requirements
### Feature Restrictions by Region
Some features may be illegal in certain countries:

- **Safety features**: Disable the `safety` overlay and related `socialReports` entries where police/speed camera reporting is prohibited
- **Social overlays**: Restrict `SocialOverlay` features based on local regulations


### Data attribution
- **GrabMaps**: The SDK uses GrabMaps data.
- **OpenStreetMap**: In regions outside Southeast, where GrabMaps data is not available, the SDK uses OpenStreetMap data. Provide proper attribution per the [OpenStreetMap license](link://https://osmfoundation.org/wiki/Licence).

- **Wikipedia**: Display appropriate attribution when using Wikipedia content, following [Reusers' rights and obligations](link://https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Copyrights#Reusers'_rights_and_obligations).
