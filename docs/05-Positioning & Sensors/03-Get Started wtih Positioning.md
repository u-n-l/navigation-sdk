# Get Started With Positioning
The Positioning module provides location data for navigation, tracking, and location-based services. Use GPS data from the device or integrate custom location data from external sources.

## Grant Permissions
### Step 1: Add application location permissions
Configure location permissions based on the platform:

**Android**

Add the following permissions to `android/app/main/AndroidManifest.xml` within the `<manifest>` block:
```
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION" />
```
More information about permissions can be found in the [Android Manifest documentation](/link:https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission).

**iOS**

Add the following lines to `ios/Runner/Info`.plist within the `<dict>` block:
```
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>Location is needed for map localization and navigation</string>
```
Add the following to the `ios/Podfile`:
```
post_install do |installer|
    installer.pods_project.targets.each do |target|
        flutter_additional_ios_build_settings(target)

        target.build_configurations.each do |config|
        config.build_settings['GCC_PREPROCESSOR_DEFINITIONS'] ||= [
            '$(inherited)',
            ## dart: [PermissionGroup.location, PermissionGroup.locationAlways, PermissionGroup.locationWhenInUse]
            'PERMISSION_LOCATION=1',
        ]
        end 
    end
end
```


### Step 2: Get user consent
Use the [permission_handler](/link:https://pub.dev/packages/permission_handler) plugin to request and manage location permissions:

> ⚠️ **Attention:** Follow the [platform specific setup](/link:https://pub.dev/packages/permission_handler#setup) for the permission_handler package to correctly configure permissions for your application.

```
// For Android & iOS platforms, permission_handler package is used to ask for permissions.
final locationPermissionStatus = await Permission.locationWhenInUse.request();

if (locationPermissionStatus == PermissionStatus.granted) {
    // After the permission was granted, we can set the live data source (in most cases the GPS).
    // The data source should be set only once, otherwise we'll get GemError.exist error.
    GemError setLiveDataSourceError = PositionService.setLiveDataSource();
    showSnackbar("Set live datasource with result: $setLiveDataSourceError");
}

if (locationPermissionStatus == PermissionStatus.denied) {
    // The user denied the permission
    showSnackbar("Location permission denied");
}

if (locationPermissionStatus == PermissionStatus.permanentlyDenied) {
    // The user permanently denied the permission
    // The user should go to the app settings to enable the permission
    showSnackbar("Location permission permanently denied");
}
```
The code requests the `locationWhenInUse` permission. If granted, call `setLiveDataSource` on the `PositionService` instance to use real GPS positions for navigation.

When the live data source is set and permissions are granted, the position cursor appears on the map as an arrow.

> 💡 **Tip:** For debugging, use the [Android Emulator](/link:https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator-extended-controls)'s extended controls to mock the current position. On real devices, use apps like [Mock Locations](/link:https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ru.gavrikov.mocklocations&pli=1) to simulate location data.
> 
> On iOS (simulators and devices), mock the location from Xcode for GPX replay. See more [here](/link:https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/simulating-location-in-tests).

## Receive Location Updates
Register a callback function using the `addImprovedPositionListener` and `addPositionListener` methods to receive position updates. The listener is called continuously as new position data becomes available.

> 💡 **Tip:** Consult the [Positions guide](/03-Core/03-Positions.md) for more information about the `GemPosition` class and the differences between raw positions and map-matched positions.

### Raw positions
Use the `addPositionListener` method to listen for raw position updates as they're pushed to the data source or received via sensors:
```
PositionService.addPositionListener((GemPosition position) {
    // Process the position
});
```
### Map-matched positions
Use the `addImprovedPositionListener` method to register a callback for map-matched positions:
```
PositionService.addImprovedPositionListener((GemImprovedPosition position) {
    // Current coordinates
    Coordinates coordinates = position.coordinates;
    print("New position: ${coordinates}");

    // Speed in m/s (-1 if not available)
    double speed = position.speed;

    // Speed limit in m/s on the current road (0 if not available)
    double speedLimit = position.speedLimit;

    // Heading angle in degrees (N=0, E=90, S=180, W=270, -1 if not available)
    double course = position.course;

    // Information about current road (if it is in a tunnel, bridge, ramp, one way, etc.)
    Set<RoadModifier> roadModifiers = position.roadModifiers;

    // Quality of the current position
    PositionQuality fixQuality = position.fixQuality;

    // Horizontal and vertical accuracy in meters
    double accuracyHorizontal = position.accuracyH;
    double accuracyVertical = position.accuracyV;
});
```

> 📝 **Note:** During simulation, the positions provided through the `addImprovedPositionListener` and `addPositionListener` methods correspond to the simulated locations generated as part of the navigation simulation process.

## Get Current Location
Use the `position` getter from the `PositionService` class to retrieve the current location. This returns a `GemPosition` object with the latest location information or `null` if no position data is available. Use this to access the most recent position without registering for continuous updates:
```
GemPosition? position = PositionService.position;

if (position == null) {
    showSnackbar("No position");
} else {
    showSnackbar("Position: ${position.coordinates}");
}
```
A similar getter is provided for map-matched positions: `improvedPosition` returns `GemImprovedPosition?` instead of `GemPosition?`.
