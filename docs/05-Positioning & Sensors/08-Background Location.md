# Background Location
Some use cases require location access when the app is in the background. To enable this, configure both **iOS** and **Android** platforms with the appropriate permissions and services.

> 💡 **Tip:** Enable background location support for features like recording, navigation, or content download (maps can be large and take time to fetch).


## Configure iOS
Update your `Info.plist` to request permission for background location access:
```
<key>NSLocationAlwaysAndWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>Location is needed for map localization and navigation.</string>

<key>UIBackgroundModes</key>
<array>
    <!-- Include other modes as needed -->
    <string>location</string>
    <string>processing</string>
</array>
```

## Configure Android
Declare permissions in your manifest and implement a foreground service to keep location updates alive.

### Add required permissions
Include the necessary permissions and service declarations in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION" />
<!-- Needed for foreground service -->
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE_LOCATION" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.POST_NOTIFICATIONS" />
```
> 💡 **Tip:** On Android 10+ (API level 29+), request ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION explicitly at runtime in your app's permission request flow.

### Implement a foreground service
Android requires a foreground service to run background location tracking. Without it, the operating system may terminate your app's background processes, leading to loss of location updates.


>  🚨 **Alert**: Create a foreground service on Android to ensure location updates continue when the app is in the background.

## Configure Sensor Settings

Enable background location in the SDK by initializing the sensor configuration in your Flutter code:

```
final dataSource = DataSource.createLiveDataSource();

if (dataSource == null) {
    throw "Error creating data source";
}

final config = dataSource.getConfiguration(DataType.position);

config.allowsBackgroundLocationUpdates = true;

final err = dataSource.setConfiguration(type: DataType.position, config: config);

if (err != GemError.success) {
    throw "Error setting data source configuration: ${err.toString()}";
}
```
