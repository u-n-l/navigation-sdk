# Positioning and Sensors
The Positioning module provides powerful tools for managing location data in your app, enabling features like navigation, tracking, and location-based services. It offers flexibility by supporting both real GPS data and custom location sources, allowing for dynamic and accurate position tracking. In addition, the Recorder module complements the Positioning capabilities by enabling the recording of sensor data. With customizable settings, it allows you to tailor the recording process for various data types, such as video, audio, or sensor information.
