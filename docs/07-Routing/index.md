# Routing

Routing functionality provides a robust solution for calculating, customizing, and analyzing routes for various transportation needs. 

You can: 
- calculate routes between a start and destination point, 
- include intermediate waypoints for multi-stop routes, 
- determine areas accessible within a specific range
- retrieve turn-by-turn instructions, traffic event details, and estimate time of arrival (ETA) along with travel durations and distances. 

The system supports a variety of options such as computing terrain profiles for elevation data, displaying routes on a map, and handling public transit routes.
