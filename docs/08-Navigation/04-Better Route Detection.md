# Better Route Detection
Monitor traffic conditions and automatically evaluate alternative routes for optimal navigation. This feature provides real-time route adjustments, reducing travel time and improving efficiency in dynamic traffic environments.


## What You Need
> 📝 **Note:** **Prerequisites:**
> - Route computed with specific `RoutePreferences` settings
> - Active traffic data on the route
> - Significant time gain (over 5 minutes) for alternative routes

## Step 1: Configure Route Preferences
Configure the `RoutePreferences` object with the following required settings:

- `transportMode` — `RouteTransportMode.car` or `RouteTransportMode.lorry`
- `avoidTraffic` — `TrafficAvoidance.all` or `TrafficAvoidance.roadblocks`
- `routeType` — `RouteType.fastest`

```
final routePreferences = RoutePreferences(
  routeType: RouteType.fastest,
  avoidTraffic: TrafficAvoidance.roadblocks,
  transportMode: RouteTransportMode.car,
);
```
Add additional settings to `RoutePreferences` during route calculation, provided they don't conflict with the required preferences above.

### Additional requirements
**Traffic data:**
Traffic must be present on the active navigation route for callbacks to trigger.

**Time savings threshold:**
Alternative routes must offer time savings exceeding five minutes to be considered. This ensures meaningful route adjustments.

> ⚠️ **Attention:** Better route detection will not function if the required conditions above are not met.

## Step 2: Register Notification Callbacks
Register callbacks using `startSimulation` or `startNavigation` methods from the `NavigationService` class:

- `onBetterRouteDetected` — triggered when a better route is identified. Provides the new route, total travel time, traffic-induced delay, and time savings compared to the current route.
- `onBetterRouteInvalidated` — triggered when a previously detected better route is no longer valid. Occurs if the user deviates from the shared trunk, a better alternative appears, or traffic conditions change.
- `onBetterRouteRejected` — triggered when no suitable alternative route is found during the check.
  
> 📝 **Note:** You must manually manage and switch to the recommended route. The navigation service does not automatically switch routes.

```
NavigationService.startSimulation(
  route,
  onBetterRouteDetected: (route, travelTime, delay, timeGain) {
    print("Better route detected - travel time: $travelTime s, delay: $delay s, time gain: $timeGain s");
    // Handle the route
  },
  onBetterRouteInvalidated: () {
    print("Previously found better route is no longer valid");
  },
  onBetterRouteRejected: (reason) {
    print("Better route check failed: $reason");
  },
);
```

## Step 3: Trigger Manual Checks (optional)
The system automatically checks for better routes at predefined intervals when all conditions are met.

Manually trigger a check using the `checkBetterRoute` static method from the Debug class. The `onBetterRouteDetected` callback is invoked if a better route is found; otherwise, `onBetterRouteRejected` is triggered if no suitable alternative exists.
```
Debug.checkBetterRoute();
```
