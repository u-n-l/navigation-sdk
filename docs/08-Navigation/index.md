# Navigation
The Navigation SDK offers developers a comprehensive solution for building turn-by-turn navigation systems within mobile applications. The SDK features critical tools like:
-  live guidance 
-  offline support 
-  warning alerts (such as speed limits and traffic conditions) 
-  real-time navigation adapts dynamically to the user's progress, notifying them of any route deviations and recalculating the path as needed

The SDK also supports a location simulator for testing navigation functionalities during app development.
